# NaiveBayes_Implementation
I learnt it from my bootcamp with Edureka. It was really helpful and went a long way in making me realise the true potential of Naive Bayes.

The link to the documentation for Edureka's NB is : https://www.edureka.co/blog/naive-bayes-tutorial/

Feel free to fork and implement the code according to you. Please note do not copy paste Edureka's code, chances are it will not work. ;)

DataSet is also attached!
